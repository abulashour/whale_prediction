# Predicting potential whales in mobile games
Using user-level behavioral and purchase data for a user's first 7 days in-game, we use an XGBoost model to classify whether a user will become a whale (high spender) or not. Model total accuracy is at 99.3%, while precision is at 99.1% and recall at 78.6% (the team preferred better precision at a risk of lower recall)

# Dataset
The dataset provided shows user-level behavioral and purchase data for spenders in a mobile game. Dataset parameters include features such as time spent, interaction with special events, and purchase behavior.

** This project was done for a private company, and thus the dataset will not be available due to privacy reasons

# Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a user will become a whale, in order segment the potential whales and target them with unique offers and high levels of customer care
